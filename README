# Bowling Game Coding Exercise 

Create a program, which, given a valid sequence of throws for one game of American Ten-Pin Bowling, produces the total score for the game​. ​Your code will become the core of a bowling score management system, so make sure it fully complies with the input and output requirements, and represents your best code.
